# Hotel Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple yet comprehensive Hotel Management System implemented in C++. It provides a basic example of a management system for a hotel where rooms can be booked, records can be viewed and edited, and various other tasks can be performed.

## Features
Room Booking: This feature allows you to book a room. You can enter the customer's name, address, phone number, and the number of days they plan to stay.

Customer Record: This feature displays the record of a customer. You can view the customer's name, address, phone number, the number of days they are staying, and the total fare.

Rooms Allotted: This feature shows all the rooms that have been booked.

Edit Record: This feature allows you to modify the details of a booking. You can change the customer's name, address, phone number, and the number of days they are staying.

## Installation and Usage
To use this system, you need a C++ compiler. You can compile the source code using the command `g++ main.cpp -o main` and then run the program using the command `./main`.

## Future Improvements
Future updates will include more features such as online payment and room service management.
